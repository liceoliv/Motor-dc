# Motor-dc


This project uses Arduino to control two DC motors using an L298N H-bridge motor driver that allows the user to control the speed and direction of each motor, making it a versatile choice for motor control applications. Sensors are used to determine when the motors should be turned on or off based on external conditions, such as proximity to an object or a change in environmental conditions. The Arduino code for this project is available on Github, along with instructions for building and using the system. With this project, users can create customized motor control systems that can be programmed to respond to specific conditions or inputs, making it ideal for a range of applications, from robotics to home automation.
